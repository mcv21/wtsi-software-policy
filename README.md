LaTeX source for the WTSI software policy and boilerplate headers. 

How to use boilerplate headers
------------------------------

1. Clone the git repository, either from Github or from the internal git server (e.g. `git clone git:/repos/git/ic/wtsi-software-policy.git`).
2. Change to the boilerplate directory (e.g. `cd wtsi-software-policy/boilerplate`)
3. Type `make` to build boilerplate headers for a variety of languages (`sed` is required to be in the path for this step)
4. Copy the appropriate header into your project and customise as required.
